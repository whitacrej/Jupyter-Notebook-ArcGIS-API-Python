    "\n",
    "This session is a 2-4-1 session: Learn Jupyter Notebook and the ArcGIS API for Python (yes, this is different than ArcPy…)! The Jupyter Notebook environment allows users to run and save Python code and workflows interactively and, when utilizing the ArcGIS API for Python, visualize the output as maps and charts. This session is perfect for beginners who want to build their [Pythonic](https://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html) muscles and also learn more about using Python for ArcGIS Online.\n",
